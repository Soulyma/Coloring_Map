Using java i managed to implement AStar algorithm on a map to color each city in a color by taking the shortest way and each neighboring cities have a different color.
The code is 5 five classes.
- Node class : to define what is there in each node
- Edge class : to define what is there in each edge (the conector between any two nodes )
- Map class : to define all nodes and edges in the map ( there is a photo for it )
- Algo class : the class that contain all the algorithm
- Coloring class : the class that has the coloring action happeneing
